### Back to the future 1. - Using email as social media

The Internet was built on federated services and we still all rely on email as the backstop communication even when we set up fancy new social media services, and it is the ultimate federated service with millions of email servers around the world working together. Why do we need to use centralised services like facebook when we can all already communicate. Starting with the assumptuion that we really want small closed group communication (like WhatsApp), define a core set of email message templates and build a new email client that uses these to provide a user experience that feels like social media rather than the clunky email clients we use today. You could use something like keybase.io as the infrastructure to distribute public keys, so that messages can be encrypted end to end. Some background reading [here](/on-things-end-to-end/).

### Back to the future 1a. - Can we fix the email reading experience

While the first project sees a more structural fix to the way in which email is used, this project woudl be to leave the email the way it is and develop a set of text processing tools that woudl allow email threads simply to be presented as conversations, eliding all the indented repeated nonsense, legal disclaimers, email headers and other fluff that generally makes reading it more tedious than it needs to be. This project could focus on really doing a knock out job on the text processing or include more UI expereince around the overall interface. Personally, I don't get why any of the major companies have not done this! 

### Back to the future 2. - Personalised RSS reader mobile app

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) for those who have forgotten it, or never heard of it, provides a feed of updates to websites - for example news sites use RSS feeds allowing you to monitor new news stories and download short abstracts. So subscribing to a set of RRS feeds provides you with a personally curated news feed you can read through a news reader aggregator app - I used [feedly](https://feedly.com). Contrast this with having a social media company decide which news sources it might promote based on possibly unknown profiling, and foreign powers paying to promote certain stories. However, if you subscribe to lots of RSS feeds you are overwhlemed by irrelevant news. So the project is to build an RSS news reader app _for mobile_ (several excellent projects last year did webservices) that allows the creation and then refinement, by monitoring reading habits, of a personal news profile to prioritize news stories. This would then provide personalised news feeds without invading privacy. Enchancements could include reading your own social media output to augment the profile, sharing the profile across multiple of your devices along with which articles are read/unread.

### Databox 
Each of these projects needs a discusison as there are quite a few options to each...

I am particularly interested in projects related to the [Databox project](https://www.databoxproject.uk); details of the mission are outlined in the paper ["Personal Data: Thinking Inside the Box"](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.04737v1.pdf). Databox is about the control of personal information. Our very own Prof Greenhalgh talking here on "What is Databox?".

There are many project possabilities related to this, and I would welcome
students suggesting their own projects. Here are some
of my thoughts:

- PrivAd "alike" - [PrivAd](http://mpi-sws.org/tr/2009-004.pdf) was an attempt to provide privacy preserving tailored advertising; Databox provides a natural platform to realise this to enable directed marketting and advertising without tracking.
- SOCKS or transparent webproxy and mobile app characterisation - configure a personal server/router to capture all URLs emitted by a mobile phone / tablet device and characterise the behaviours of apps.
- Build and evaluate an interesting application for Databox, using the Databox SDK
