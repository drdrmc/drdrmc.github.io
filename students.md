### Bluetooth dosimeter - COVID 19 topical!

Contact tracing is a contentious issue and fraught with technical problems. However, a simple "bluetooth dosimeter" which records unique bluetooth devices you have seen and when (after discarding your own, housemates and neighbours!) is an index of how much social contact you may have had. If we presented this to people and showed them the times of day etc they were in busy places, perhaps even augmented with their location data, this might form the basis for behaviour change to reduce exposure, e.g. avoiding busy shopping or travel times. As with the COVID tracing on iPhone and Android, if attempting to do this bluetooth tracking in an app on a phone it would need to run all the time, or be builtin by Apple and/or Google. Instead we could use a simple arduino or raspberry pi (like) device which could be always on in your pocket and simply download the data once a day (when plugged in to recharge) to a platform for visualization. We can supply the hardware if anyone is interested in building the system and visualization, possibly linking to location data and perhaps even as a stretch goal running a few trials wiht users.

### Online corpus linguistics

Corpus Linguistics is the study of language as expressed in corpora (i.e. samples) or real-world text. As an example, we may wish to discover how often (more precisely how frequently) the name of a product, TV show or politician appears in sentences with words that are complementary or negative. We would like to study the words people are exposed to as they use a web-browser, but we need to do this in a privacy preserving way. The project is to build a browser plug-in that would perform basic corpus linguistic functions (simple statistics like word frequency, and frequency and distance of co-locations of two words etc), and collate these into a plain text storage format (so a user might inspect it) which could then occasaionally be shared by a user, taking an explicit action after reviewing it, with researchers. Importantly for reseacrhers this could provide a privacy preserving way to access the words used in private messages, not merely those made public. This project requires knowlege of Javascript, HTML and CSS.
