I am particularly interested in projects related to the [Databox project](https://www.databoxproject.uk); details of the mission are outlined in the paper ["Personal Data: Thinking Inside the Box"](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.04737v1.pdf). Databox is about the control of personal information. Our very own Prof Greenhalgh talking here on "What is Databox?".

There are many project possabilities related to this, and I would welcomestudents suggesting their own projects. Here are someof my thoughts:- SOCKS or transparent webproxy and mobile app characterisation - configure a personal server/router to capture all URLs emitted by a mobile phone / tablet device and characterise the behaviours of apps- Build and evaluate an interesting application for Databox, using the Databox SDK

### Back to the future - Using email as social media

The Internet was built on federated services and we still all rely on email as the backstop communication even when we set up fancy new social media services, and it is the ultimate federated service with millions of email servers around the world working together. Why do we need to use centralised services like facebook when we can all already communicate. Starting with the assumptuion that we really want small closed group communication (like WhatsApp), define a core set of email message templates and build a new email client that uses these to provide a user experience that feels like social media rather than the clunky email clients we use today. If you are heroic you could implement the Signal key exhange protocol by email to build in robust security... Some background reading [here](/on-things-end-to-end/).
