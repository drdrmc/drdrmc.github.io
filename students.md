### Bluetooth dosimeter - COVID 19 topical!

Contact tracing is a contentious issue and fraught with technical problems. However, a simple "bluetooth dosimeter" which records unique bluetooth devices you have seen and when (after discarding your own, housemates and neighbours!) is an index of how much social contact you may have had. If we presented this to people and showed them the times of day etc they were in busy places, perhaps even augmented with their location data, this might form the basis for behaviour change to reduce exposure, e.g. avoiding busy shopping or travel times. As with the COVID tracing on iPhone and Android, if attempting to do this bluetooth tracking in an app on a phone it would need to run all the time, or be builtin by Apple and/or Google. Instead we could use a simple arduino or raspberry pi (like) device which could be always on in your pocket and simply download the data once a day (when plugged in to recharge) to a platform for visualization. We can supply the hardware if anyone is interested in building the system and visualization, possibly linking to location data and perhaps even as a stretch goal running a few trials with users. This project can be in any language supported on your choosen HW platform.

### Online corpus linguistics

Corpus Linguistics is the study of language as expressed in corpora (i.e. samples) or real-world text. As an example, we may wish to discover how often (more precisely how frequently) the name of a product, TV show or politician appears in sentences with words that are complementary or negative. We would like to study the words people are exposed to as they use a web-browser, but we need to do this in a privacy preserving way. The project is to build a browser plug-in that would perform basic corpus linguistic functions (simple statistics like word frequency, and frequency and distance of co-locations of two words etc), and collate these into a plain text storage format (so a user might inspect it) which could then occasaionally be shared by a user, taking an explicit action after reviewing it, with researchers. Importantly for reseacrhers this could provide a privacy preserving way to access the words used in private messages, not merely those made public. This project requires knowlege of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

### Personalised RSS reader mobile app

RSS for those who have forgotten it, or never heard of it, provides a feed of updates to websites - for example news sites use RSS feeds allowing you to monitor new news stories and download short abstracts. So subscribing to a set of RRS feeds provides you with a personally curated news feed you can read through a news reader aggregator app - I used _feedly_. Contrast this with having a social media company decide which news sources it might promote based on possibly unknown profiling, and foreign powers paying to promote certain stories. However, if you subscribe to lots of RSS feeds you are overwhlemed by irrelevant news. So the project is to build an RSS news reader app for mobile (several excellent projects last year did webservices) that allows the creation and then refinement, by monitoring reading habits, of a personal news profile to prioritize news stories. This would then provide personalised news feeds without invading privacy. Enchancements could include reading your own social media output to augment the profile, sharing the profile across multiple of your devices along with which articles are read/unread via a cloud service (don't build that, just use a file in Dropbox or something!). Mobile app development experience essential.
