[Horizon](http://www.horizon.ac.uk/) is a research institute centred at the [University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk) focussed on Digital Economy Research. Created through the [RCUK](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/) 
[Digital Economy programme](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/Digital/), it is investigating the technical developments needed if electronic information is to be controlled, managed and harnessed to develop new products and services for societal benefit and economic growth. It combines technological advances with an exploration of the ethical, sociological, legal and business transformation issues involved.

Horizon also links to partners in many other institutions, including the universities of Brunel, Cambridge, Exeter, Glasgow, Imperial, and Strathclyde.
