Dear PowerMeter User,<br />
We first launched Google PowerMeter as a <a href="http://Google.org/" >Google.org</a> project to raise awareness about the importance of giving people access to their energy information. Since our launch, there's been more attention brought to this issue, and we're excited that PowerMeter has helped demonstrate the importance of access to energy data. However, our efforts have not scaled as quickly as we would have liked, so we have decided to retire PowerMeter.<br />
You will continue to have access to the product until September 16, 2011, after which time you will no longer be able to access your PowerMeter account. We know that having access to your energy information has helped you save energy and money. There are many options available for you from our device and utility partners. Please visit this page to learn more: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/powermeter/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1342532" >http://www.google.com/support/powermeter/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1342532</a><br />
We also understand that having your historical energy data is important to you. We've made it easy for you to download your data. To export your PowerMeter data to a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, log in to your account and go to "Account Settings." More information can be found here:<a href="http://www.google.com/support/powermeter/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=164264" >http://www.google.com/support/powermeter/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=164264</a><br />
