Summary: Overall, the EDPB’s adoption of the Guidelines provides additional clarity and certainty for data
controllers and processors to comply with the GDPR. We provide three recommendations as to how the Guidelines can be improved in the final
version:
<br /><br />
- Further clarify the nature of the influence on the purposes and means of the processing
exercised by the technology providers, especially when there is a clear power imbalance;
<br /><br />
- Explicitly specify that the arrangement between joint controllers as required by Article 26
should take into account which controller is best-positioned to fulfil a specific duty, ideally
with real-life examples of domestic controllers;
<br /><br />
- Encourage joint controllers to agree on such an arrangement in a fair manner by allowing
the arrangement to take effect on how data subject requests are handled, provided that it
does not create any extra burden on the data subject
