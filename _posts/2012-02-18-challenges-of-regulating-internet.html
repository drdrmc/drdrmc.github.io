<a href="/images/a-mere-trifle.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="/images/a-mere-trifle.jpg" height="213"></a>So a very<a href="http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/events/challenges-regulating-internet/"> interesting talk</a> from Simon Hampton of Google; followed by good discussions and a fine dinner at St. Johns to boot - well done the Connections team.<br /><br />
Simon made a great point on scale and illustrated it with <a href="http://www.onehourpersecond.com/">YouTube statistics amusement</a> - simply put "it's huge".

Or to quote a great man and the guide (chapter 8):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space, listen..."</blockquote>Most folks, including regulators, just don't get how big it is - and headline message from Simon "Regulate for abundance over scarcity" - I liked that.<br /><br />

Simon used the image above (and ancient tale from <a href="http://capitalforte.blogspot.com/2011/06/bite-size-science-mere-trifle.html">this blog</a>) to illustrate his point  - he reckons we are at square 32 on the chess board and there's 32 more doublings to come; hmm - more faith in Moore's law than I can summon but I'd maybe begrudge him 16; at current rates that's still another 25 years...<br /><br />
