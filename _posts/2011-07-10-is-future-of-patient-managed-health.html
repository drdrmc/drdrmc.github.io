RIP Google Health and Powermeter (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-google-health-and-google.html">see here</a>); and MSFT Hohm at the same time. In the immortal words of Half Man Half Biscuit "A million housewives every day pick up a tin of beans and say, 'what an amazing example of synchronisation'".<br /><br />
And so as they ask[ed *] over at BioPoliticalTimes, <a>are we done with patient managed records?</a><br /><br />I think the thing here is not to loose track of the fact that patient access to records rather than holding them is a key service we want to see... <br />
