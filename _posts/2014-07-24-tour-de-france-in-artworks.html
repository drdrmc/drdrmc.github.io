I was somewhat surprised noting the course goes through Lourdes to find a <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-no-title-p04787">bicycle based place holder</a> rather than a geolocated artwork - surely Tate has something for such a site of religious significance (that thought triggered not least by watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2177771/">Monument Men</a> last night!).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gill-our-lady-of-lourdes-p08080" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/P/P08/P08080_7.jpg" /></a>Off to the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/">Tate website</a> and search on Lourdes and of course there something - from the religious and colourful dichotomous&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill">Eric Gill</a> "<a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gill-our-lady-of-lourdes-p08080">Our Lady of Lourdes</a>".<br /><br />But only one. And there's got to be so much more out there. Roll on the day that we can get a federated image search across all cultural archives and start to bring to life the richness embedded in these cultures.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240148820/BBC-wants-to-build-a-cultural-API">Cultural API</a> anyone?<br /><br />
