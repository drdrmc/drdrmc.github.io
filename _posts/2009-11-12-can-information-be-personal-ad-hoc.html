Some very interesting thoughts on information privacy and the Data Protection Act from a lecture at the<a href="http://www.rsescotlandfoundation.org.uk/CRF/">Caledonian Research Foundation</a>(<a href="http://www.rsescotlandfoundation.org.uk/">RSE</a>)by Baroness Onora O'Neill - "<a href="http://www.rsescotlandfoundation.org.uk/media/resources/pdfs/crf/prize07%5B1%5D.pdf">Can Information be Personal</a>".<br /><blockquote>"The definition [of ‘processing’] in the Act is a compendious definition and it is difficult to envisage any action involving data which does not amount to processing within this definition"<br /></blockquote>I was amused reading this lecture this week as it co-incided with finding an example not covered by the Act - from the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/">ICO </a>we find a <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2007/bluetooth.pdf">press release</a>from 2007!<br /><blockquote>"However, the Regulations only apply to messages sent over a public electronic communications network and we have concluded that Bluetooth messages are not in fact sent using such a network."</blockquote>Nor a lot of research networks of the last number of years! (e.g. <a href="http://www.haggleproject.org/">Haggle</a>...)<br /><br />I am told this loophole is to close.
