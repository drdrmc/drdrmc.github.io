I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile">Computerphile</a> asked me about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's Law</a> because he saw I once worked for Intel....

Read the classic paper by Gordon Moore <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/assets/media/classic-papers-pdfs/Moore_1965_Article.pdf">here</a>. The picture from Moore's paper I was trying to draw from memory shows the "sweet spot" curves that actually indicate why building chips with too few transistors for a given generation is as bad an idea as trying to cram on too many!<br /><br />
There's also a <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/165331-intels-former-chief-architect-moores-law-will-be-dead-within-a-decade">great article</a> on the issues ahead by Bob Colwell from August 2013 - he gives it ten years. A<span id="intelliTXT" name="intellitxt">s Intel’s former chief architect, and </span>now as head DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office, I'd say he's an authorative voice on this.<br /><br />
