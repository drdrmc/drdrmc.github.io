These discussions along with many of the  definitions that others have offered often focus on the technical  capabilities of the system – does it have embedded computing; can it  communicate; does it use the internet; does it have a screen; does it  involve a “thing” that we previously had never thought to put online?<br />Some aim to partition even further by defining which things&nbsp;are not IoT:<br /><ul><li>That’s not IoT, that’s a “connected product”</li><li>That’s not IoT, that’s M2M</li><li>That’s not IoT, that’s a smart phone</li></ul>The list of things that some consider are not IoT could get very long  and still provide us with no useful insight or handle for discussion.<br />As noted in a previous IoTUK post, people have been putting  unexpected things online for years, and traditionally being considered  weird for doing it – but that is the joy of research and innovation.<br />So for me, IoT is not about technical capabilities or novelty, rather  it is a social phenomena that reflects a significant proportion of  society, and importantly businesses, who have started to recognise that  there is value in building a virtual presence for many of our everyday  physical things. These connected ‘things’ are enabled by the continued  reduction in cost of communications, computing, storage and sensing.<br />So shall we discard the consideration of technical capabilities when  thinking about IoT? Absolutely not. In considering any system design, we  need to understand how to trade off the technical complexity against  the functional and commercial requirements.<br />We also need to consider the risks, such as privacy and safety, for  example, alongside the requirements, or not, for data sharing. Those two  latter topics will be the subjects of forthcoming blogs and finally a  report from IoTUK, but for now we should consider the technical  complexity alone.<br />At the most basic level we should continue to embrace even the  simplest technologies that enable us to uniquely identify passive  objects. RFID and NFC tags still have much value to add, while  advancements in visual marker technologies such as <a href="https://d-touch.org/" target="_blank">d-touch</a> allow designers to hide the equivalent of barcodes in decorative  patterns. However, even such long established technologies present us  with emergent issues due to the scale of deployment, such as the ‘<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/may/25/contactless-cards" target="_blank">clash of the plastic</a>’.  Who would have expected we’d be carrying multiple tags in such close  proximity? Do a personal survey of your pockets and bags: contactless  payment cards, building access tokens, loyalty cards, and smart phone  etc.<br />One specific vision for the use of IoT is how it will help look after  our&nbsp;ageing&nbsp;population and keep them living independently in their homes  for longer. Technology will provide monitoring and assistance through  devices that are both worn and carried, as well as embedded in homes.<br />Looking at the IoT landscape today, there has been a shift from  simple vertical applications to a wider landscape of ecosystems built  around various proprietary standards such as Apple’s HomeKit, Google’s  “Works with Nest” and Samsung’s SmartThings. The downside to these  proprietary architectures is that products and services are not  compatible across vendors – not so much of a problem when the devices  are all portable, but a challenge for IoT where elements of the systems  will be embedded in the buildings around us. In the commercial  deployment context this sort of technical complexity is a dream (=  profit) for systems integrators,&nbsp;who will build and maintain bespoke  software infrastructures to make it all interoperate.<br />However, returning to our care in the home application, the need is to&nbsp;<em>reduce</em>&nbsp;the technical complexity by ensuring systems are designed to interoperate.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hypercat.io/">Hypercat</a>&nbsp;has  done a great job for enumerating things. Next, let’s standardise some  of those APIs (Application Programme Interface) to “things”…I mean how  many ways do we need to talk to a thermostat?<br />You can follow Derek McAuley at <a href="https://twitter.com/drdrmc" target="_blank">@drdrmc </a>and don’t forget to follow IoTUK <a href="https://twitter.com/IoTUKNews" target="_blank">@IoTUKNews</a>.</div></div></div></div></div>
