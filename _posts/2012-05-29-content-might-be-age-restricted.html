Thank goodness for trusty old VPN service that lands me in Canada (see location) and bypasses all of this nonsense. I acquired this VPN service when my job took me to SA regularly and I observed every other Skype packet was targeted for death; local sources reported it was because the ISP = phone company. Which reminded me that a friend, of a privacy minded nature - let's call him "druid", pointed me at a fine article on <a href="http://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Communications_Capabilities_Development_Programme">CCDP</a> on Friday; took a few days to focus on it, but made me realise that maybe the sooner everyone is using VPNs to the Cayman Islands (other offshore havens are available) the sooner we could avoid spending money on surveillance technology so easily bypassed. <br />
