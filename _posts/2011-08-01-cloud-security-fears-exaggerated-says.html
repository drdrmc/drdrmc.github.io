 An interesting read over at <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/">Computer World</a>:<blockquote><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9218702/Cloud_security_fears_exaggerated_says_federal_CIO?source=rss_keyword_patrick+thibodeau">"A lot of people are sort of driving this notion of fear around security" Kundra said. "And the reason I think that's been amplified, frankly, is because it preserves the status quo."</a></blockquote>

  Talking to the folks from <a href="http://the-portal.co.uk/">The Portal</a> recently and starting to appreciate the levels of automation and small number of folks who are actually needed to manage the automation in these data centres, the issues of "who has the time?" and "wouldn't even know where to look" provided a lively topic of discussion; however, still think I'd like a smattering of "encryption at rest". Belt and braces don't you know.
