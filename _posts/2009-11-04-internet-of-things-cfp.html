Interesting conference for that mixed physical and virtual world.....<a href="http://www.iot2010.org/">http://www.iot2010.org/</a>  
<blockquote>The "Internet of Things (IoT)" disrupts with the today's Internet limitations of human-entered data: technologies like RFID, short-range wireless communications, real-time localization, and sensor networks empower computers to perceive the world for themselves. Standardized infrastructures capable of managing, sharing and processing this captured data will be necessary in order to bring the Internet of Things  into commercial use. This interlinking of physical world and cyberspace  foreshadows an exciting endeavor that is highly relevant to researchers, corporations, and individuals. </blockquote>
