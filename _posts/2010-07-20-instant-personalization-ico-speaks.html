So, annoyed with facebook's recent introduction of Instant Personalization I thought to complain to the ICO. I received the response below.

<br />Caveat surfer.<br /><br />I do wonder if in future we might not seek to understand how local legislation, enacted at the wishes the citizens of a country, might be brought to bear on an every growing global digital economy.<br /><br />Mac.<br /><br />

Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to you; this is due to the large caseload we are currently experiencing.

The DPA covers the processing of personal data (i.e. data which relates to a living individual) within the UK.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as Facebook is based and operated from the United States, it does not fall under the jurisdiction of the DPA. We are therefore unable to pursue this matter.<br /><br />You may find useful information in our guidance note „Using social networking sites safely‰<br /><br />I am sorry that we cannot be of assistance on this occasion.
