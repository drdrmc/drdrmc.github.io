Returning from a trip today I find disgruntlement in the McAuley household - "Interwebs is broken" is the user&nbsp;assessment. Initial&nbsp;probes show it's actually sort of connected, but it's clearly got some issues...<br /><br />So "to the batcave" - I fire up Wireshark running off a my MacPro second Ethernet port attached to my home Ethernet switch which happens to have a SPAN port&nbsp;that mirrors all traffic to and from the home router&nbsp;(this is a geek level desire that in a home ethernet&nbsp;switch&nbsp;costs you £40&nbsp;extra&nbsp;to satisfy). Technicals aside, what I find is going on is this (starting the network packet capture at about BST 22:46):<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FKRTGXfdnmM/T8adUyoxxBI/AAAAAAAAAMo/YSGxzwxb2BE/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-05-30+at+23.05.42.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="227" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FKRTGXfdnmM/T8adUyoxxBI/AAAAAAAAAMo/YSGxzwxb2BE/s320/Screen+Shot+2012-05-30+at+23.05.42.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Now at this point I'm miffed - I've paid a premium for years for an "unlimited" service - looks like someone decided to change the arrangement. I know my ISP does have "capped" services, were the deal is that there's no limit from 2300 until 0700, so I've clearly been dumped into this camp - they've suppressed us to about 400kb/s during "peak hours" and we got switched back on at 23:00.<br /><br />OK you say - so suck it in; well 1) that was not the deal and then 2) actually we can't.<br /><br />Our household is now at a baseload &gt; 512kbps, and as such is suffering the same problems as laid out by<a href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-nagle84.html"> Nagle (1984)</a> and <a href="http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-mogulf1.html">Mogul (1987)</a>&nbsp;- congestion collapse; so lets face it not that new a problem.<br /><br />How has we go to this&nbsp;ridiculous&nbsp;situation you ask - well, it started with "Why am I paying £50 per month to Sky?" - so we signed up for NetFlix, and started using iPlayer; as background we have a home energy monitor that chats to a cloud service every few seconds; we also now have 3 iPhones in the house; Diablo 3 was released and last week that was at least 3 downloads (24Gb); ...<br /><br />So I've figured out why "the Interwebs is broken", but I did bring to bear some several years of network&nbsp;measurement&nbsp;experience; not every household is so unfortunate as to have a resident&nbsp;networking&nbsp;geek.<br /><br />So lets roll forward to the Internet of Things; let's think home care for the elderly using all the latest tech, and then, "sorry your mum's dead because she watched too much iPlayer and we cut her bandwidth".&nbsp;Jeez, we've got a long way to go to sort this out.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm engaged in a dialogue with my ISP; I'll not name them until they shame themselves.<br /><br />
