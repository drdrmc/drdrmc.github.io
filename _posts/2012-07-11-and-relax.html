Addendum: one unintended consequence when I looked at the energy  monitoring in my house is that I find a 10W increase on the "networking gear"  monitor in my house... so a hidden Â£10 per year extra charge! I use our C-Aware / Desimax energy website <a >www.electric20.com</a> (now retired) to capture my energy use... Not surprising I guess that the signal processing to do 80Mbps down 1/2 mile of phone line takes somewhat more than the old ADSL... <br /><br />
