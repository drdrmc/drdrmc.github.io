<div style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><a href="/images/openqwaq.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" height="200" src="/images/openqwaq.png" width="320" /></a>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> we hear of one Zarniwoop who is "...in his office, but on an intergalactic cruise".<br /><br />Well today, I'm into the third day of a workshop but in my house.<br /><br />


  We're using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openqwaq/">OpenQwaq</a> and running around in a virtual conference centre trying to figure out the question to life the universe and everything; well more precisely <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/2012/Pages/sustainablesociety.aspx">"achieving work-life balance in a digitally dependent world</a>". This virtual workshop funded by the <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/ourportfolio/themes/digitaleconomy/Pages/default.aspx">RCUK Digital Economy</a> theme.<br /><br />However, we're also part of an experiment in that we are being studied as part of the <a href="http://www.horizon.ac.uk/Current-Projects/Creativity-Greenhouse">Creativity Greenhouse project</a> funded by <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a> looking a novel ways to facilitate online creative workshops and after several pilots we're into the real thing with serious money on the table for successful research proposals.<br /><br />Great fun so far and beats the heck out of audio conferencing, and when we finish at 5 tonight I'm home already and a mere 100yds from a fine pint of <a href="http://www.woodfordes.co.uk/html/our_beers.html">Woodford's Wherry</a>.<br /><br />Isn't this what the digital economy and work/life balance is all about? :-) <br /><br />
