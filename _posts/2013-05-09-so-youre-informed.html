Given the pick up on <a href="http://www.orchid.ac.uk/eprints/108/">a very recent paper</a> at <a href="http://chi2013.acm.org/">CHI</a> on the complexity of 'terms and conditions' and issues of informed consent I think Ewa can call<i> <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/kei/impacts/">impact</a></i> for this research output since <a href="http://bettingexpert.com/">bettingexpert.com</a> have picked it up and applied it to a bunch of betting websites - their results <a href="http://www.bettingexpert.com/blog/terms-conditions-study">here</a>.<br /><br />

(Psst - we are not informed so there is no consent.)<br /><br />Due to circumstance beyond my control I found myself in Egypt recently and captured this image - I did think that given the general literacy of the day, it managed to both convey the relevant detailed message to those that could read the hieroglyphs and yet a simple to understand message to those that couldn't.<br /><br />Ts&amp;Cs as graphics?<br /><br />
