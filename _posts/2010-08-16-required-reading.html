In the article by Jeffrey Rosen, <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html">"The
Web Means the End of Forgetting"</a>, he talks about many fine ways to
deal with the issue of the web having a habit of remembering things;
from online hygiene to social and technical take downs. I do hope the
next round of digital economy start ups realise that the sensitive
stewardship of its subscribers or customers privacy is a major selling
point!
