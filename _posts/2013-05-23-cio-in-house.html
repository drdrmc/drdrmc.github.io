<a href="/images/cdec.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/images/cdec.png" /></a>Over the last year I've been involved in many of the events organised by the <a href="https://www.innovateuk.org/">Technology Strategy Board</a> to shape the creation of the <a href="https://cde.catapult.org.uk/">Connect Digital Economy Catapult</a> (CDEC) and have been keen to see how we can pass the results coming out of the Research Council's <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/Digital/Pages/home.aspx">Digital Economy programme</a> downstream into the hands of innovators. Hence I've been delighted to be offered the role of <a href="https://cde.catapult.org.uk/blogviews/-/asset_publisher/XwNC0wXN7ru2/blog/the-adaptive-challenge-of-appointing-a-chief-innovation-officer">Chief Innovation Officer</a> (in residence) at CDEC to help shape it during the start up phase.
