Summary: Overall, the EDPB’s adoption of the Guidelines represents a helpful step forward in promoting
ethical and privacy-friend design and default approaches, and the current version has largely
covered right issues with an appropriate level of details and useful examples. To sum up the specific
comments outlined above, we provide three recommendations as to how the Guidelines can be
improved in the final version:

- Throughout the Guidelines, make a stronger case for technology providers to fully align with
the DPbDD requirements as imposed on data controllers, and provide further examples on
how this can be achieved;

- In Section (“Elements to be taken into account”), specify certain PET approaches with
examples that are already available and easy to implement for data controller to show
better compliance with data protection principles;

- In Section (“Implementing data protection principles […]”, in particular the “Transparency”
and “Lawfulness” sub-sections), further clarify that data processing information and options
should be provided in an objective and neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative
language or design.
