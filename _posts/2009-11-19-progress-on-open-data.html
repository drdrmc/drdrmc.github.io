Good to see that Tim and Nigel have been making the most of the
opportunity offered to open up the govt data - very useful for Horizon
we should be watching these data sources eagerly as they come online
to see what new and interesting applications they might enable. They
have a column in the Times Online <a
href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6920761.ece">"Put
in your postcode, out comes the data"</a>.<br /><br />Right now I'd
appreciate a map that allowed me to click on the street lamp outside
my house and sent off email to whoever is responsible for fixing it
:-)
