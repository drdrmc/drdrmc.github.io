My personal research for the last four years (drdrmc posts passim.) has been around personal data, so it is exciting to now be involved with CDEC in looking at what next for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-midata-vision-of-consumer-empowerment">midata</a>, and the <a href="http://www.midatalab.org.uk/">midata innovation lab</a>. More on these initiatives as they roll out...<br /><div><br /></div><div>The skills agenda is very high on the agenda in the report and I am reminded of two very interesting conversations with colleagues from across academia and industry: firstly at the Research Councils UK e-Infrastructure Users' Strategic Conference last week and earlier this week at the E-Infrastructure for SMEs Workshop. At the former, the great quote from a colleague in Arts and Humanities "...we need computational thinking skills in all our undergraduates..." and repeatedly from the HPC centres "...we have the equipment, we need the cross disciplinary skills now..."
