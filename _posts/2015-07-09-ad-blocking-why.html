Curious morning on the tweets as <a href="https://twitter.com/IanBrownOII">@IanBrownOII</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/IanBrownOII/status/619049572762001408">responds</a> to a (sponsored (*)) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/olswang-partner-zone/2015/jul/01/digital-marketers-rise-ad-blocking-advertising?CMP=share_btn_tw">Guardian article</a> claiming that the reason people use ad-blockers is that the ads are poor quality - a call to arms for advertisers everywhere!<br /><br />

<a href="/images/blockedads.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/images/blockedads.png" /></a>Ian flags his excellent <a href="http://t.co/m8sKAFukHZ">work </a>from 2010 on privacy preserving advertising that points the way to support advertising but solves what most of us think is the issue - arbitrary tracking and unknown sharing of user profile information.<br /><br />Even the Guardian was at it - in visiting the article the website tried to inject 5 trackers into my browser when I visited the site, but trusty old <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">ghostery </a>was having none of it. Thank goodness I am old and crusty enough to use a personal computer into which I can install this sort of plug-in - god save those on mobile devices who have no ability to control the tracking. We hear <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/mobile-operating-system/42622/opinion/apple-ios-9-ad-blocking-explained-and-why-its-a-ba">ad-blocking is coming soon to an OS near you</a>, but I do sincerely hope it is not done by having Apple track everything you do and then block others.<br /><br />However, moving to the bottom of the Guardian page we find an article "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/olswang-partner-zone/2015/jul/08/internet-of-things-iot-privacy-google-nest-labs-amazon">Internet of things: intelligent household devices raise privacy concerns</a>" (sponsored by the same folks as the aforementioned article), where that irrepressible tweeter <a href="https://twitter.com/Maurizio_Pilu">@Maurizio_Pilu<></a> is explaining the importance of <b>privacy by design</b>.<br /><br />So we have two articles in the Guardian with completely different views of the world - but being a scientist I need to know - why do you use and ad-blocker? We could set up Qualtrics, but hey, we can mine the social media - to the tweets with you:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">#adblockadssuck or #adblockprivacy</blockquote>You might agree with both, but hey give the most important one.<br /><br />
