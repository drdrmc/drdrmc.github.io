<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><i>Why Johnny Can’t Opt Out: A Usability Evaluation of &nbsp;Tools to Limit Online Behavioral Advertising</i>.<br /><br />A great <a href="http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/techreports/2011/tr_cylab11017.html">tech report</a>&nbsp;from <a href="http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/">CMU CyLabs</a> on issues in self-regulation and opt-out mechanisms in online advertising. Conclusion - "fundamentally flawed".<br /><br /><table border="2" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_1529178823"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z7Vk4wJUk78/TrqK4i3yQHI/AAAAAAAAAII/4R6khfGo_fs/s1600/Screen+Shot+2011-11-09+at+14.14.38.png" /></a></span></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">No browser&nbsp;should&nbsp;be without it!</a></td></tr></tbody></table>Yup - even as a technologist with <a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>, <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlocker Plus</a>, rather obsessive browser settings and as of a few minutes ago having <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">opted out</a> of the 52 companies that target ads at Chrome according the Digital Advertising Alliance (curiously hard to find online!) - I still find it all disconcerting.<br /><br />I have for years been registered with the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/"><span id="goog_1529178807"></span>Telephone<span id="goog_1529178808"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/">Mail</a> Preference Services in the UK - this is not self regulation, this is legislation, and it works pretty well and cuts out most of the junk - the remaining junk in the McAuley household is blow-ins through magazine subscriptions - <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a> can I sign out of this please? However, &nbsp;I still get telephone direct marketing from folks outside the UK; interestingly&nbsp;when I ask&nbsp;which&nbsp;UK company they are working on behalf of,&nbsp;the&nbsp;phone goes dead. Unfortunately&nbsp;I can't report them because the caller-id is always blocked, but companies (and you know who you are) are clearly trying to bypass the legislation. So would you now trust them to self-regulate online?<br /><br />Thanks to Gilad for pointing me at the original article.<br /><br />P.S. At 14:38 today, just as I finalised this, I had an international telesales call in broken english asking for <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/misc/obituaries/needham/">Mr Needham</a> or <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/misc/obituaries/sparck-jones/">Mrs Needham</a>&nbsp;(previous residents at this address from 14 years ago!). Good friends, long may they be&nbsp;remembered, the operator received some ripe anglo-saxon they may have difficulty translating.</div>
