<i>Why Johnny Can’t Opt Out: A Usability Evaluation of  Tools to Limit Online Behavioral Advertising</i>.<br /><br />
A great <a href="http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/techreports/2011/tr_cylab11017.html">tech report</a> from <a href="http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/">CMU CyLabs</a> on issues in self-regulation and opt-out mechanisms in online advertising. Conclusion - "fundamentally flawed".<br /><br />

<table border="2" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="/images/ghostery.png" style="clear: right; float: center; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="/images/ghostery.png"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">No browser should be without it!</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

  Yup - even as a technologist with <a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>, <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlocker Plus</a>, rather obsessive browser settings and as of a few minutes ago having <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">opted out</a> of the 52 companies that target ads at Chrome according the Digital Advertising Alliance (curiously hard to find online!) - I still find it all disconcerting.<br /><br />

  I have for years been registered with the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Telephone</a> and <a href="http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/">Mail</a> Preference Services in the UK - this is not self regulation, this is legislation, and it works pretty well and cuts out most of the junk - the remaining junk in the McAuley household is blow-ins through magazine subscriptions - <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a> can I sign out of this please? However,  I still get telephone direct marketing from folks outside the UK; interestingly when I ask which UK company they are working on behalf of, the phone goes dead. Unfortunately I can't report them because the caller-id is always blocked, but companies (and you know who you are) are clearly trying to bypass the legislation. So would you now trust them to self-regulate online?<br /><br />

Thanks to Gilad for pointing me at the original article.<br /><br />

P.S. At 14:38 today, just as I finalised this, I had an international telesales call in broken english asking for <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/misc/obituaries/needham/">Mr Needham</a> or <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/misc/obituaries/sparck-jones/">Mrs Needham</a> (previous residents at this address from 14 years ago!). Good friends, long may they be remembered, the operator received some ripe anglo-saxon they may have difficulty translating.<>br /> <br/>
