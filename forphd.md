### Looking for PhD supervision?

Do not email me a CV directly.

If you are looking at joining the [Horizon CDT](https://cdt.horizon.ac.uk/), instructions for applying can be found [here](https://cdt.horizon.ac.uk/apply/). 

If applying for a more normal PhD route (including self-funding), then please follow the university process documented [here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/how-to-apply/research.aspx). Importantly, consider the requirement in step 4 of that process to “Write a research proposal”, specific guidance [here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/how-to-apply/research-proposal.aspx). 

If applying for the annually announced School funded PhD posts (https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/studywithus/postgraduateresearch/index.aspx), and you are seeking my support, I require you to complete the "Write a research proposal" step outlined above, confirm that what you are suggesting is related to my current (and not historical) research, and only then email me.
