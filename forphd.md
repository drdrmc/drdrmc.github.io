### Looking for PhD supervision?

Do not email me a CV directly.

If you are looking at joining the [Horizon CDT](https://cdt.horizon.ac.uk/), instructions for applying can be found [here](https://cdt.horizon.ac.uk/apply/). 

If applying for a more normal PhD route (including self-funding), then please follow the university process documented [here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/how-to-apply/research.aspx). Importantly, consdier the requirement in step 4 of that process to “Write a research proposal”, again guidance [here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/how-to-apply/research-proposal.aspx). 

If applying for the annually announced School funded PhD posts advertised [here](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/studywithus/postgraduateresearch/index.aspx), and you are seeking my support, I require you to complete the "Write a research proposal" step outlined above, confirm that what you are suggesting is related to my current (and not historical) research, and only then email me. (Closing date for applications this years is Feb 13th 2022).
